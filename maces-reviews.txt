Great service
Great Chili Con Carne, Excellent Cheesesteaks
As previously written by HenryM on 1-13-2012 "The old-fashioned manners and friendliness of the bartender here are heart warming
Went there for a fresh brew and food, but was blown away by the chili con carne
Cheesesteak was good and the cool old-school bartender style put this place over the top
Another tiny Irish pub
Friendly service
Drinks were alright
This is my go-to spot on the weekend when I know every other place in town is packed
We're always seated right away and the drinks are a good deal for the area
There are plenty of televisions and the food isn't half bad at all
It's a good place to relax without being constantly bothered by staff - just relax, have some drinks and some hangover food
The old-fashioned manners and friendliness of the bartender here are heart warming
This review might be a little unfair since I didn't order any food or drinks, but I couldn't even make it past the front door because it smelled like a CAT BOX
My co-worker and I tried to go on our lunch break and we both just had to turn around and walk back out the door
This place was reminiscent of other Pennsylvania dive bars which will remain nameless
I ordered the chili on the server's recommendation and it was pretty good, I must say
Visited with a non-drinker so we didn't imbibe, but all the standard offerings were available
The bar smelled like, well, a dive bar
If you are good with that then check this place out
The staff was limited during the after 10pm hours, which seemed weird
The waitress was not the friendliest in town, but she warmed to become more Wisconsin and less Arctic circle after a bit
In all honesty, it's an okay place where you can get a decent meal after the rest of the town seems to roll-up on a weekday and the outdoor seating, complete with 26" TV from the 80's on a roll-up cart was actually pretty cool
If you are an average Joe with a sense of humor, give this place a fair shake
Pros: cheap happy hour prices, BEER
Con: The ceiling dripped on me
I changed my location, and it dripped on me there too
Call me old fashioned, but no matter how much cheap beer an establishment throws in front of you, they should still strive to minimize their ceiling dripability factor
Extreme heat breeds camaraderie in any place that is below 90
Multliple mice
I can drink bottled beer only ~ no food or
Draught beer because I saw so many
Avoid at all costs
Just thinking back on my limited experiences at this establishment gives me the creeps
At the time, I worked at a nearby law firm and this was a favorite for support staff members and alcoholic attorneys alike (sorry for blowing up anyone's spot)
It is one of those places that you sneak off to for lunch to have a beer or four, and if you see anyone from work, you silently acknowledge them and immediately forget that you saw them there
So I guess it's cool that this unspoken code exists
However, the place is downright nasty
Cobwebs hang in the corners and every surface has that sticky feel to it
You know what I'm talking about
Mace's Crossing is as close to a dungeon as you can possibly get in the middle of Center City
the food was delicious
the waitress- not very friendly
the atmosphere is great for a sunny warm workday lunch
i would eat here again because of the food, not the service
Im from Houston and hit bars all over downtown Philly
What a great dive bar
If you are a middle class, feet on the ground kind of person, this was a great place that we hit over and over while in town for 4 days
Their cheese steak is among the top 3 (And I had a lot) that I tried
Ive seen a few other reviews calling the place a rathole, I disagree, the staff was always cleaning in the little spare time they had and the whole place seems well kept up, clean glasses and fresh food
Philly is kind of old, so of they thing Mace's is a rathole, they should steop outside and look around, ya know
this place is kind of crappy
I pass it every day on my way back and forth to work and I've never stopped in until last night, because I really had to use the bathroom and didn't feel like going to Friday's
Having experienced a fantastic dive that people complained about earlier this week, I had high hopes for Mace's Crossing
It smelled weird, the bathrooms weren't clean
I lost my appetite when I walked in, which wasn't helped by the nasty french fries that I was served
The best part of the evening was when this old hippie came in with a large knitted jester's hat and a stuffed monkey strapped to his waist and took 20 minutes in the men's room
Dunno what that was about but it made me giggle
I might go back if I'm drinking or something but I wouldn't go back for the food at all
I've been here once because the wait was too long for TGIFriday's
There are two floors, my boyfriend and I were seated upstairs
The good thing is that we were near a window, the bad thing was the condition of everything
The place needs renovating
Well, we were there for lunch, I think at night it must be some local dive on Parkway
I guess I was expecting a restaurant
There was a table of 8 or so a couple of tables away
I think they were the reason why we waited for what seemed like an hour for our hot sandwiches
When it arrived, it was pretty sorry
I think I've had better at lunch trucks
I don't recommend this place if you're looking for a decent lunch
Works better as a dive
One of the better shitholes in the city
Line up 4 more shots of Jameson and those mice disappear and the crowd gets MUCH better looking
From the outside, this place looked like it was going to be awesome
EPIC FAIL
The best beer they had on tap was yeungling
Come on
My dinner
Sounds awesome but the execution was not so awesome
It was nice that it was so cheap, but my sandwich came out and was pretty much a gigantic mess of cheese onions and bread
I could barely find the chicken
When i went upstairs to the bathroom, i passed the kitchen
It looked like what i would expect to see at a college dormroom
it was seriously one guy with a deep fryer and a griddle
I guess my cheesey chciken was all they could master with what they were given
Definitely not worth a visit
I walked by Mace's on the way to the Franklin Institute and immediately loved the look of it
I said "wow, doesn't that place look cool
If we have time I want to stop in there
From the looks of it, I was expecting more of a gastro-pub, and was startled to see such low prices
The highest priced item on the menu is $10
We walk in and it feels like a cozy irish bar with a small downstairs area with a few booths and a couple TVs, and then an upstairs area
I was excited, until I saw the very small and average beer list
I opted for a Yuengling, one of the two most exotic brews they had
Also ordered some fish 'n chips, hoping the food would outdo the beer selection
The food came out and it looked not unlike something you'd find at McDonald's
My "chips" were crinkle cut fries that probably came out of a big Ore Ida freezer bag, and the fish had that bizarre, tell-tale processed trapezoidal shape that you'd expect from Long John Silvers
Michelle's "grilled chicken sandwich" was almost indistinguishable as a grilled chicken sandwich
It was all white and gooey and had a couple tiny chunks on it
It kinda looked like a patty of tartar sauce
I appreciated the friendliness of our waitress, but the limited beer selection, and poor food was a turn-off
A previous reviewer said that the reason for Mace's continued existence is how inexpensive it is compared to the rest of the area
It certainly is cheap, but it doesn't feel like a good value to me
Cheesesteak sandwiches are pretty good here
Service a bit slow but pleasant
Nice outdoor seating
Guinness on tap - oh yeah
Went to Mace's with a group of friends last Saturday afternoon
Snagged a nice table outside, which was great for people watching
I think the best surprise was the free sausage from their outdoor grill
Four different kinds
Service was good - our waitress was very friendly &amp; quick
Is the bathroom sketchy
Is the ambiance weird
Of course
But for sitting outside, enjoying a few cheap beers, and free food, it's a nice spot
Warning: do not visit Mace's Crossing if you have any form of clinical depression
This is not the bar that will make you forget all your troubles
This bar will, however, make you temporarily forget that you're in the pricey part of town as you pound down one of the 5 inexpensively priced draft beers in this musty, low-ceiinged local watering hole
My recollection is needfully blurry but I think you can expect Yuengling, Sam Adams seasonal, Smithwicks, Guiness, and Bud Light on tap
and that is all
Somehow that qualifies this place to be an Irish Pub in a city already packed to the gills with Irish Pubs
The most surprising aspect of Mace's Crossing is the crowd
I mean, it usually isn't packed, but they get a decent amount of people after work in this dive
The least surprising aspect is the food
I'd be hard pressed to locate more generic bar food
I will say that the service is pretty good, the waitresses seem to really hop to it
but there's only one reason people keep coming back here: it's cheaper than everywhere else
In a part of town where the happy hour is almost non-existent, their prices at least fall into the realm of reason
If you're going with some friends and you know you'll have fun no matter how grim your surroundings, then this might be the bar for you
Quintessential neighborhood pub verging on being a dive - and verging on being in a neighborhood, because it seems to be wedged around a lot of non-residential property
But thye have a good group of regulars, as I could see even on a Sunday night
I didn't try the food, and I doubt I ever would - but to hang out on the deck for a few pints - or inside to watch some baseball - it's not half bad
And Lager for $3 a pint - sweet
not rushing back - but happy I tried it out
I've walked by here countless times and found it to be a cute looking establishment
I've viewed this as a "neighborhood" type bar tucked into the hustle of the city
Now that I've experienced it, I will be sure to keep viewing it from a distance
The drinks were not bad, the customers and the bartender (although loud) were friendly hence the two stars
But we should have caught on when the bartender ordered chinese delivery
the food was FOUL and the servers were clueless
If you like food out of bag and thrown into a microwave, then served by nincompoops
go to Mace's for a bite otherwise stick to the drinks
If you are hungry, ask the bartender to include you in his delivery order or  pay a few bucks more and go around the corner to public house
It's a dive, but I like the cheeseburgers and onion rings, and how they have their twinkly colored Christmas lights on all year-round
I don't love the lonely steep trip upstairs to use the ladies' room, but I guess they're working with what little space they have
There's a smallish patio too, but you'll be subjected to cigarette smoke if you go outside
I don't get what all the fuss is about
The same people who would stand by a dumpster in July and snarf down a cheese steak with flies and pigeons all around are complaining that MacE's is a bit scruffy
OK, it's a bit on the dive side, but me like 'em dives
The jukebox (customer operated) is always playing something interesting, depending on the crowd makeup
Speaking of which, on the couple of evenings I was there, the demographics were across the board, but lots of 30-somethings, men and women
There are a couple of TVs and sports is the mainstay for viewing
I had the cheese steak
It was just as good as anywhere else
I didn't find the place "dirty" or "scummy"
More of a "scruffy", rough around the edges kind of place
Yeah, it's a bit dark, like a good neighborhood pub should be
If you want bright lights and noise, go to TGIFridays, it's next door and much more expensive
I tried another "Neighborhood Pub" a few blocks down and came running back to MacE's Crossing
I was in Philadelphia for a few days last week and stopped by here for some bar food and drinks when the TGI Friday's in the Embassy Suites across the street where I was staying was too crowded
I have to admit that I was jet-lagged, but I didn't notice half of the things that the other reviewers hated on this place about
Yeah it's a dive but they make a stiff drink and decent chicken fingers, and they've got the baseball games going on the flat screens
Prices were reasonable and the place was nearly full by the time I left late in the evening
If you're not too picky and are traveling without children give this place a shot, it gets the job done
Nothing special
Nice, small outdoor seating section
Loud, annoying crowd during my visit
Nice Staff
This is by far one of the most repulsive bars I've visited yet in Philly
I went with my boyfriend and two friends, and we were pretty much alone at the bar
The bartender was cool and attentive, but the place was just a dump
It smelled terrible, like stale cigarette smoke and mold
The food was bland and greasy, there was a lipstick stain on the lip of my friend's water glass, and when we left, my boyfriend and my roommate had grease stains on the knees of their pants from the underside of the bar that wouldn't come out in the wash
No joke
They had to throw their pants away
I was repulsed and will NEVER return
I wish i could give them a 0, but I liked the bartender, and it was pretty hilarious that they had some of the beer taps coming out of a cooler
Ate here with friends, as we were at the Franklin on a Sunday, and desperately looking for some place to eat
Many places were closed and the only other place we could find was TGIF's - ugh
This place looks like a cozy neighborhood bar and it is
Typical greasy spoon type fare
It was very inexpensive and the onion rings were awesome
Potato skins were way to greasy for my taste
Guys said the burgers were good
So long story short - it was fine in a pinch but I wouldn't recommend it per se
So my friend and I wandered in here Sunday morning in an attempt to avoid TGI Friday's as very little else was open (I'm sure the Embassy's $68 brunch across the street was great, but I'll work on marrying wealthy in the meantime and maybe I'll find out for myself someday)
Not much here in the way of ambiance, so my personal bar was set pretty low as we perused the menu
Honestly, I expected very, very little when I ordered the broccoli and cheese quiche (it's the one thing I make really well), but I was pleasantly surprised
Very nice
Great cheese, nice crust
My friend ordered French toast, which was also surprisingly flavorful (she was delighted by the side of "actual ham" as well)
Cheap as hell and nice servers, too
A glorified airport bar without the airport, Mace's is a perfect place to people-watch if your idea of fun is pointing out which 50-something travelling businessman is going to cheat on his wife with which lonely 40-something unmarried travelling businesswoman
Your room or mine
Burgers and beers are cheap-ish for those desperate for a bite and a buzz, or if the End Times are upon us and swarms of locusts are preventing you from going to a classier nearby jaunt, like Friday's
wow - that place is a dive
and usually i mean that as a compliment, but not this time
i am thankful that the evening was nice, so we sat outside
inside was dark and dingy in an awful kind of way
beer selection was good, but the food
again awful is the only way to describe it
if i wanted mrs. paul's fish and chips, i would have gone to the supermarket - not paid almost $10 for it at mace's
the nachos were bland and salty
my boyfriend had the french dip sandwich
why was it in a bread bowl
only go for beer's and when it's nice outside and there's room on patio
Stopped by here when I touched down for a conference
Very simple menu - sandwich, chips, fries - but it does the trick if you want a quick bite
Had the turkey club with a side salad
Held me over until I got to some real food :)
Good Guinness, great bartenders, great wings
I was happy
Here’s a little bitty building–a former carriage house–that has outlived everything else nearby, enduring despite the march of skyscrapers that has consumed everything around it
Saved from demolition by nothing other than random chance, we might call it an immortal pile of bricks
The story of this carriage house begins almost three centuries ago–and in another part of town
In 1741, they subdivided Northeast (Franklin) Square–what the Penns called “Race Street Lot”–into leaseable spaces
One of them was rented right away by the German Reformed Church for use as a burial ground
In 1763, the church would purchase the lot for 189 pounds
In 1795, after five decades in use as a graveyard, Philadelphia’s government wanted its square back
They offered $30,000 for the lot, but the church refused
The city would claim that the fenced-off area, covered in weeds, vines, and an overabundance of gravestones, was a public nuisance
The courts declared that the Penns’ sale of the lot was invalid in the first place
In exchange for ripping off the church, the city offered $5,000 and a new plot of land, the area bounded by Race, Cherry, Schuylkill Fifth (18th) and Sixth (17th) Streets
This new space was much larger than the Franklin Square graveyard
The German Reformed Church, after moving all the bodies and gravestones in, didn’t even come close to filling all the space
Even after three more decades, they still had plenty of room
The church sold three sides of the property to private developers who would build large rowhouses along its perimeter around 1840
At the end of the 1860s, the graveyard finally ran out of room
The German Reform Church was forced to create a space for itself at the new West Laurel Hill Cemetery and move all the bodies and grave markers there, where they still reside today
The space left over in the 1700 block of Cherry Street was then split up into small lots
In 1870, the rowhouses on the eastern side each got an 18′ x 49′ extension to their backyards
It was the last of the long row of identical homes that once backed-up to the graveyard and would now have an extended rear space
Though its not exactly clear when it happened, the owners of 126 North 17th decided to build a carriage house on the new rear space of their property that would face Cherry Street
In 1916, after 126 North 17th and a few of its neighbors became soon-to-be-destroyed city property, the carriage house became its own address: 1714 Cherry Street
The Tay-Miller Chemical Manufacturing Company moved in, producing snake oils and a car cleaner called “Hand-i-Wash ” 
The Parkway’s trail of destruction reached 17th and Cherry in September, 1917 and took until the start of 1918 to break through due to the bulkiness of the Medico-Chirurgical Hospital Complex
Later that year, Tay-Miller’s Hand-i-Wash product became a big hit, causing the company to move out of the small carriage house to a much bigger facility at 20th and Market
The little building and the remaining row of homes nearby were then acquired in 1920 by the Sun Oil Company (Sunoco), who planned to build a 12-story Parkway-facing headquarters designed by none other than Horace Trumbauer
The project went into a familiar development limbo that lasted for most of the 1920s
Sun Oil eventually decided to build their new HQ on Walnut Street instead
The land they cleared for the Parkway HQ became a surface parking lot; the carriage house would be painted white, get a small addition, and become a refreshment stand
For the next thirty years, the carriage house would be one of the only structures on the south side of the Parkway between 17th and 19th Streets and one of only three small buildings that survived in the Parkway’s destructive wake–and the only one that directly faces it
It had the Sun Oil-created surface lot to its east and the Municipal Court’s parking lot to its west
The building would go through a myriad of uses during this time with long periods of abandonment in between
The surface lots would finally get tall buildings in 1964 and 1968, leaving the little carriage house in their shadows
In November 1975, brothers Bernard, James, and Robert Thompson purchased the property for $70,000 and about a year later opened their restaurant, Mace’s Crossing, after overcoming some issues with their liquor license
